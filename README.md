## Development

CodeForDaytonWeb uses [npm](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm) and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Follow those links to get the prerequisites installed before starting.

Once the toolchain is installed, simply run:
```
git clone https://github.com/codefordayton/CodeForDaytonWeb.git
cd CodeForDaytonWeb
npm install
npm start
```

Running `npm start` will start a server, and should open a browser window at http://localhost:9000/.
