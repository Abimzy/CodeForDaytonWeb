            <p>We are a <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Brigade</a>, which means we're volunteers that contribute our talents toward improving the way our local governments and community organizations use the web. Brigade is about
                action and you're here because you are someone who takes action.

            <p>We're a community-driven organization. We like to solve problems that can benefit many people. This means giving everyone a voice (and a vote) in our process. If you have a civic project that you'd like us to look at, <a href="http://codefordayton.uservoice.com/">submit it to our backlog</a>            and give the community a chance to vote. We pull from the backlog as we finish projects -- ideas with the most votes get worked on first.</a>
